# Tektoncd Model Context Protocol server

*This project is being bootstrapped, the README is a bit bare for the moment*.

This project provides a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for the tektoncd projects.
It initially focuses on [`tektoncd/pipeline`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) objects but will over time add support for other tektoncd projects.
